<summary>A GIS-based flood risk and real-time rainfall monitoring system developed for the Scottish Highlands using Python (ArcPy) and ArcGIS Pro. Terrain derivatives (slope, flow direction, accumulation) were combined with land use, soil, and infrastructure data to model flood vulnerability. Real-time SEPA rainfall data was integrated and visualized on an interactive ArcGIS Online map.</summary>

<description>This map is part of a flood early-warning GIS system designed for the Scottish Highlands. It combines geospatial and real-time data to identify areas at risk of flooding using: - Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for terrain processing - Slope, Flow Direction, Flow Accumulation for runoff modeling - Land Use & Soil Type to assess surface permeability - Infrastructure locations (e.g., power stations) to assess exposure - Real-time SEPA API integration to retrieve rainfall data and visualize live conditions Python scripting (ArcPy) was used for automated geoprocessing, raster analysis, and live data updates. The final product includes both static maps and an interactive web map, enabling users to explore flood risk areas and monitor sensor data in real time.</description>
